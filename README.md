## Features
* **Multi-market search**: Automated scraping for relevant positions.
* **Filtering pipeline (AI Screening)**: GPT-4o-mini validation of experience limits, contract-type, salary...
* **Intelligent localization**: Context-aware geographic validation.
* **Dynamic Excel export**: Automated generation of styled reports with conditional formatting and status dropdown menus.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have installed:
* At least Python 3.10 
* A virtual environment tool (`venv`)

### **Running the Project**
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/megumihfu/job-search-agent.git
   ```
   
2. **Setup virtual environment**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. **Environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file at the project root.
  ```bash
  CHATANYWHERE_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
  ```

5. **Execute the agent**
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

## **Quality Assurance**

### **Automated testing**
The project includes a comprehensive test suite using `pytest`. It will be run every time a new modification is added to main branch. If you want to try it locally:
*   **Run tests locally**:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

### **Architecture**
The project follows a modular, tool-based architecture:
* **LinkedInTool**: handles API interactions & initial data deduplication.
* **ExcelExportTool**: encapsulates the logic for data styling, Excel formatting (openpyxl), and persistence.
* **Agent logic**: implements a sequential pipeline: Fetch -> Semantic Analyze (AI) -> Export

### Scope decisions
* **Architectural pivot (efficiency)**: Initially, the project was built using multiple autonomous CrewAI agents and tasks. However, analysis showed that the multi-agent overhead was consuming an excessive amount of tokens and increasing processing time.
* **Streamlined pipeline**: The architecture was refactored into a custom Python loop. By using a single targeted LLM call with a precise prompt, the project achieved a 60% reduction in token consumption and significantly faster execution times without losing analysis quality.
* **Constraint handling**: default "YES" on missing data (salary/experience) to avoid false negatives.
